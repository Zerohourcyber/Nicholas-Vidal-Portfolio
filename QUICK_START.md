# Quick Start Guide - Nicholas Vidal Portfolio

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal/PowerShell in this directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages (Next.js, React, Tailwind, etc.)

## Step 2: Run Development Server

After installation completes, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Open in Browser

Once the server starts, open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Project structure
